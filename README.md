# Worst-World-RPG-Project
A game in console I made when I was bored. Don't expect me to update it! (Don't take it seriously either, it's a dumb bad game!)

What? You wanted a .exe or something? Buddy, you're playing the worst rpg! Of course not! You'll need to install visual studio to run this shit! good luck!
I don't plan on updating it, I just thought it would be funny to upload it in this current state, have fun trying to reach the end.
Also, sometimes some names generated may be a little border line, the game has multiple database for names, title, color ect... for enemies so I can't control what kind of nonsense the next enemy you might encounter will be named as.

Lastly, this game has a lot of offensive humor, don't take it seriously and if you dislike that type of humor, just don't play it that's it. It was the point to make a bad game!
