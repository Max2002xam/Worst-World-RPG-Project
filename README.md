# Worst-World-RPG-Project
A game in console I made when I was bored. Don't expect me to update it! (Don't take it seriously either, it's a dumb bad game!)

What? You wanted a .exe or something? Buddy, you're playing the worst rpg! Of course not! You'll need to install visual studio to run this shit! good luck!
I don't plan on updating it, I just thought it would be funny to upload it in this current state, have fun trying to reach the end.
Also, sometimes some names generated may be a little border line, the game has multiple database for names, title, color ect... for enemies so I can't control what kind of nonsense the next enemy you might encounter will be named as.

Lastly, this game has a lot of offensive humor, don't take it seriously and if you dislike that type of humor, just don't play it that's it. It was the point to make a bad game!

# How to play ?
Just live through the random events and sometimes write a letter or a number to do an event, I was too lazy to detect letters that weren't in caps, it was really like a slight change of code but I didn't bother so just write the letter just like it's asked! (otherwise the game will ignore your input)
The whole adventure is random, you might get lucky and have basically no threats and win super easily, or you might get the worst rng, who knows?

# How do I install ?
Get visual studio, open the project, then you can run it, you can even change the code if you want, I really couldn't care less if you cheated on this bad game.

# What are the stats?
you have the classical hp, atk, def, magic, luck , screw you. Really, the basic!

# What was the last one?
The best stat of all of them, the stat that will symbolize how screwed you are, the base value is based on how badly your base stats got splitted, its the leftover stat but that will impact events of the game in a bad way. Oh and before you ask, yes I do know how to make a more correct stat splitter to have no leftover, I even did that for enemies, I just thought it would be funny to give this little bonus stat to the player!

# How many different events are there?
Not much, got lazy. You won't really play this game for long anyway so why making more?
